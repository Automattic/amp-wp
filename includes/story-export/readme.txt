=== AMP Stories Export Archive ===

This folder contains a story that was exported using the WordPress AMP Stories editor (https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/).

It contains the actual HTML used for the story (index.html) as well as all assets that were used in it.

You can use this archive to host the generated story on another server. Note that using HTTPS is recommended.

All the assets within the story use the base URL that was configured in the AMP plugin's settings.
